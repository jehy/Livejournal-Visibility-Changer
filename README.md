Livehournal-Visibility-Changer
==============================

Bulk changing user visibility is possible only for paid users on livejournal. I didn't want to pay so I ended creating a little application which queried all my posts and updated each one's visibility using interface/flat. Worked pretty cool in 2008 :)
